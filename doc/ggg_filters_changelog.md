- [patch notes](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2627574) - new gems, base types, uniques and cards

From [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/d0isb7/lootfilter_neversinks_itemfilter_version_730/ezb1w0z/):

- The parser is now more strict about formatting. So as you can see in this very thread, some people are now getting new errors, e.g. if they have a number after a custom sound file path. Previously, that number was silently ignored; now, it raises a formatting error.
- Filters also no longer accept negative numbers for anything, since it doesn't make sense for any of the rules atm.
- Comments (marked with "#") should now work better. Previously they could cause errors in certain places because they were incorrectly interpreted as search strings/values etc. Now, they should work everywhere. If you find somewhere that comments still don't work, let me know.
- Fixed the "Your Item Filter is out of date" error message appearing too often. It's only supposed to show if the filter fails to load the very first time the game tries and the filter hasn't updated since then.
